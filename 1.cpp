    // Stage 1: Basic Organism Simulation (Using basic arrays, if-else, loops)
    // Problem
    // Start by simulating a population of organisms where each organism has a single genetic trait (like speed). 
    // The environment will have a "difficulty" (a threshold number), and if an organismâ€™s trait is above the 
    // threshold, it survives. Otherwise, it doesn't.

    // Challenge for Stage 1:
    // Genetic Diversity: Modify the project to simulate multiple traits (like speed, strength, etc.). 
    // Each organism will now have a pair of traits.
    // Calculate fitness of the organisms and select the best-fit ones.
    
    //Optional:
    // Calculate the average speed,strength and fitness of 1) All organisms, 2) Survivors, and 3) Organisms which couldn't survive.
    // Add exception handling to ensure the program handles incorrect inputs gracefully.
    // Enhance user experience and output formatting.
